Information for release 1.0.0

-Software is slow, and the API isn't the fastest either so 
  slight delay when opening the software is imminent
-Software has no certifications so it is not trusted by 
  any operating system
-If you doubt the software, the code is available to see
  at all times.
  





Newest code is a temporary fix for a problem I'm don't have the time to investigate.
